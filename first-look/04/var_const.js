//1. Create a constant variable named entree and set it to equal to the string 'Enchiladas'.

const entree = "Enchiladas";

//2. Just to check that you’ve saved the value of 'Enchiladas' to entree, log the value of entree to the console.
console.log(entree);

/*3. Great, let’s see what happens if you try to reassign a constant variable.

Paste the following code to the bottom of your program.

entree = 'Tacos'

to Clipboard

This code throws the following error when you run your code:

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
After you clear this checkpoint, if you want to see about another quirk of const in action open the hint! */

entree = "Tacos";
