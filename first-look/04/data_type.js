// 1. Use console.log() to print the typeof newVariable.

let newVariable = "Playing around with typeof.";

console.log(typeof newVariable);

// 2. Great, now letâ€™s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1.

newVariable = 1;

// 3. Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.

console.log(typeof newVariable);
